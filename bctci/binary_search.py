# Problem 29.1 Search in sorted array
"""
Given a sorted array of integers, arr, and a target value, target, return the target's index if it exists in the
array or -1 if it doesn't.
▶ Example: arr = [-2, 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11], target = 3
Output: 2.
▶ Example: arr = [-2, 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11], target = 2
Output: -1.
